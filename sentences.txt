Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving
Greed is like a double-sided blade. The more you want, the less you have.
The only impossible jounrey is the one you never start.
The way you look at things, the things you look at change.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
When you get tired, learn to rest, not quit.
It is never too late to be who you might have been.
I get to determine how bad or good my day is.
Be yourself, everyone else is already taken.
