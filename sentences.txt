Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving
Greed is like a double-sided blade. The more you want, the less you have.
The way you look at things, the things you look at change.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
When you get tired, learn to rest, not quit.
It is never too late to be who you might have been.
I get to determine how bad or good my day is.
Be yourself, everyone else is already taken.
